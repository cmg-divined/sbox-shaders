Working on random shaders with the help of AI. I don't know how to code but shaders really intrigue me as a 3D artist so I'm trying to learn with the help of AI, most of the code you'll see here was AI generated so forgive any mistakes or unneeded code.

Feel free to use these shaders for anything you need.
I'd like to thank:

https://github.com/QuackCola - for letting me use his KuwaharaFilter.cs file for applying post process shaders as well as always answering my dumb questions and explaining things.
https://github.com/wheatleymf - for helping me figure out an issue with the holograph shader and explaining things
https://github.com/NotGaylien - for assisting and answering some of my questions in s&box discord
